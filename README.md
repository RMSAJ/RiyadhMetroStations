## Introduction
Drby is an application that aims to solve the transportation dificulties especialy in my HomeCity Riyadh:
- User can locate and search for nearby metro stations, (buses would be included in the future) .
- edit & chose the user prefrence.
- CRUD operation so the user can have his own favorite stations and personal profile details.
this app uses MVVM Architectur and UDF to move the data from the Data Layer to the Domain Layer ends with the UI Layer.
